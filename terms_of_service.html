		<body>
<p>Greetings players,</p>

<p class="text">These terms of service (the &ldquo;<strong>Terms</strong>&rdquo;) set out the terms and conditions by which Reptilians offers you access to use and enjoy our games, apps, websites, and other services (the &ldquo;<strong>Reptilians Services</strong>&rdquo;). Reptilians is a gaming company with an office in &ldquo;Name of City&rdquo;. When we say &ldquo;<strong>Reptilians</strong>&rdquo;, we&rsquo;re referring to the Reptilians entity and these Terms are an agreement between you and that entity.</p>

<p class="text">Please read these Terms carefully and pay particular attention to these items:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><strong><u>Virtual Content</u></strong>.</p><p class="text"> When you click to purchase, earn, or are gifted with Virtual Content, you only get a license to access Virtual Content. You have no ownership of any of the Virtual Content you unlock and you can&rsquo;t transfer it to someone else. Virtual Content has no monetary value, is generally game-specific and you can&rsquo;t redeem Virtual Content for any type of &ldquo;real world&rdquo; money.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong><u>Refund Policy</u></strong>.</p><p class="text"> You lose the right to change your mind, cancel the order and get a refund if you get immediate access to or download your digital content. There are some exceptions to this rule, but we have a strict policy on refunds.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong><u>User Rules</u></strong>.</p><p class="text"> You agree to follow our User Rules. These rules govern both in-game behavior and certain out-of-game conduct while using Reptilians Services.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
      <h2 class="title">1. Your account</h2>
      <h2 class="title">2. Account termination</h2>
      <h3 class="title">2.1. How can my account be suspended or terminated? (If you break the rules, justice will be visited upon your account!)</h3>
      <h3 class="title">2.2. Will Reptilians maintain my account forever, even if I stop using it? (If you abandon your account for a very long period, we may terminate it after giving you notice and an opportunity to re-activate it.)</h2>
      <h3 class="title">2.3. What happens if Reptilians terminates my account? (No games for you and you will lose access to any purchases including Game Currency and Virtual Goods.)</h3>
      <h2 class="title">3. Limited license</h2>
      <h3 class="title">3.1. What can I do with the Reptilians Services? (You can enjoy the Reptilians Services for your own, personal, non-commercial use.)</h3>
