        <p className="text">
          These terms of service (the &ldquo;<strong>Terms</strong>&rdquo;) set
          out the terms and conditions by which Reptilians offers you access to
          use and enjoy our games, apps, websites, and other services (the
          &ldquo;<strong>Reptilians Services</strong>&rdquo;). Reptilians is a
          gaming company with an office in &ldquo;Name of City&rdquo;. When we
          say &ldquo;<strong>Reptilians</strong>&rdquo;, we&rsquo;re referring
          to the Reptilians entity and these Terms are an agreement between you
          and that entity.
        </p>

              When you click to purchase, earn, or are gifted with Virtual
              Content, you only get a license to access Virtual Content. You
              have no ownership of any of the Virtual Content you unlock and you
              can&rsquo;t transfer it to someone else. Virtual Content has no
              monetary value, is generally game-specific and you can&rsquo;t
              redeem Virtual Content for any type of &ldquo;real world&rdquo;

          In an effort to constantly improve the Reptilians Services, evolve our

          likely will) evolve over time to improve the Reptilians Services or
          for regulatory or legal reasons. If we decide to entirely retire
          certain Virtual Goods that you recently purchased, we will provide you

          notice (such as through posts on our website, app or game), unless
          your account is terminated by us for a legitimate reason or by you
          under Section 2.1.1. We may sometimes change the purchasing power of
          Game Currency (for example, we might increase the number of Game
          Currency needed to purchase Virtual Goods, such as skins). We normally
          only do this in incremental steps but we&rsquo;ll give you notice
          (such as through posts on our website, app or game) if we plan to make
          changes that will significantly impact your Game Currency in a
          negative way. We don&rsquo;t provide or guarantee, and expressly
          disclaim, any value, cash or otherwise, attributed to any data
          residing on servers we operate or control, including any Game Content
          or Virtual Content attributed to your account. If we allow the sale or
          transfer of your right to access certain Game Content or Virtual
          Content, it may only be conducted via services approved or provided by
          us, if any.

          We may revise the pricing for any part of the Reptilians Services at

          that may be purchased for any one game or that may be held in your
          account in the aggregate. Additionally, price and availability of Game
          Currency and Virtual Goods are subject to change. We may restrict how
          much Game Currency you can purchase and/or use based on your location
          as we have different approaches in different locations.

          You should verify that the proper amount of Game Currency has been
          added to or deducted from your account during any given transaction.

          made with respect to your Game Currency balance. We&rsquo;ll
          investigate your claim, and in doing so, may request some additional
          info to verify it.

          hacking, cyber-attacks, data corruption/loss (where we have taken the
          steps that would reasonably be taken by companies like us to avoid
          this event occurring); or (b) acts of god, war, terrorism,
          bomb-threats, Reptilianss, embargoes, acts of civil or military
          authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes, or shortages of

          Reptilians’ failure to enforce any provision of these Terms shall in

          each and every such provision after that. Any waiver by Reptilians of
          any provision, condition or requirement of these Terms shall not
          constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such

          You agree that Reptilians would suffer irreparable harm if a breach of
          certain of these Terms (such as Section 3.2) was not specifically
          enforced and that damages would not be an adequate remedy for
          Reptilians as a result. We may rely upon this Section to ask a court
          for injunctive relief or specific performance.
