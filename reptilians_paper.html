    <p class="text">Hey, mate!</br>
        This documentation is our first step in
        understanding the future of our company and our approach. Let's be real,
        we're not fortune tellers and we're not gonna pretend like we know
        exactly what the future holds. As we continue to grow and evolve, this
        documentation may change. We're in this together with our community, and
        we're looking forward to seeing how we can shape the future together.
        If you see some mistakes or have some suggestions to improve it - please
        welcome mate, text us at <a href="https://t.me/sivkovg">@sivkovg</a>
        in Telegram or via <a
                href="mailto:hey@reptilians.band?subject=I have some text for you!">hey
            @reptilians.band</a>!</br>
        </br>
        So let's strap in and get ready to make some noise, cause the future is
        looking bright and we're excited to be a part of it!</p>
    <h2 class="title">Purpose of the documentation</h2>
    <p class="text">The purpose of this documentation is to give you, our
        community, a clear
        understanding of who we are, what we stand for, and what we're all
        about.
        We're not an average company, and we want to make sure you know that
        from
        the get-go.</br>
        </br>
        We believe in transparency and open communication, and this
        documentation is
        a reflection of that. We want you to know everything there is to know
        about
        us so that you can make an informed decision about whether or not you
        want
        to be a part of our community.</br>
        </br>
        This documentation is for anyone who wants to understand our company and
        its
        operations, for people who want to know about our products and services,
        for
        people who want to know about our vision, mission, goals, and values,
        for
        people who want to understand our token economy, our team, and our
        structure.</br>
        </br>
        We hope that this documentation will serve as a guide, not just for you,
        but
        for anyone interested in what we're doing and who wants to join us on
        this
        journey.</br>
        </br>
        <strong>*We tried very hard to keep this documentation short,
            understandable,
            and
            not look like a scammer. And it's very hard to write like that. So
            if you
            haven't read it, fuck off.</strong></p>
    <h2 class="title">Overview</h2>
    <p class="text">In short, we are IT-Company, b2c, focused on creating unique
        products with a focus on choice, where community members can have a
        direct influence on the development of our products through the use of
        Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). We are oriented to the whole world. And we
        are ready to change the world!</p>
    <details>
        <summary>More in-depth</summary>
        <p class="text">
            We're Reptilians that're out to shake things up and
            break free from the
            constraints of the status quo. We're focused on creating mobile
            games
            and mobile applications that are both fun and innovative, but we're
            not
            afraid to branch out and explore new opportunities - whether it's
            web
            services or other gaming platforms.</br>
            </br>
            And we're about flipping the script and creating a new model for how
            companies and communities can work together. Through our
            decentralized
            approach and our focus on community engagement, we hope to create a
            new
            model for how companies and communities can work together and show
            the
            world that decentralization is possible and that people can unite
            and
            manage their environment.</p>

    <h2 class="title">Idea</h2>
    <p class="text">
        The idea behind Reptilians company is to disrupt the traditional way of
        user-company interaction and create a revolutionary decentralized
        approach where community members can have a direct influence on the
        development of our products through the use of Non-Fungible Tokens
        (NFTs).</br>
        </br>
        Reptilians are transparent as hell, with all data, backlogs, and
        roadmaps (and so on, and so on) made public while creating. We're not
        afraid to be open and honest with our community and we want them to be a
        part of the process every step of the way.</br>
        </br>
        <strong>Decentralization for us isn't the product, it is the
            tool</strong>. Our community
        members will have the power to vote on changes or offer their ideas for
        our products through our voting service. Our community is like a middle
        finger to centralized authority, giving the people control over the
        direction of the company.</br>
    </p>

    <details>
        <summary>What do we believe?</summary>
        <p class="text">
            We believe in creating a comfortable and free community of
            like-minded people who share our values and are innovative and
            creative in our products. But most importantly, we're all about
            flipping the script and creating a new model for how companies and
            communities can work together. Through our approach and our focus on
            community engagement, we hope to create a new model for how
            companies and communities can interact and show the world that
            decentralization is possible and that people can unite and manage
            their environment.</br>
            </br>
            Reptilians is different from competitors because we're not just
            creating products and services, we're creating a new way for
            companies and communities to interact, we’re creating the community
            of Reptilians. All of these give our users a direct say in the
            development of our products and services. We believe that through
            our approach, we can create a new model for how companies and
            communities can work together.<strong> We're not content to just be
            another
            player in the industry, we want to be the ones leading the charge
            and paving the way for a new era of decentralized companies
            .</strong></p>
