    <h2 class="title">Introduction</h2>
    <p class="text">Hey, mate!</br>
        This documentation is our first step in
        understanding the future of our company and our approach. Let's be real,
        we're not fortune tellers and we're not gonna pretend like we know
        exactly what the future holds. As we continue to grow and evolve, this
        documentation may change. We're in this together with our community, and
        we're looking forward to seeing how we can shape the future together.
        If you see some mistakes or have some suggestions to improve it - please
        welcome mate, text us at <a href="https://t.me/sivkovg">@sivkovg</a>
        in Telegram or via <a
                href="mailto:hey@reptilians.band?subject=I have some text for you!">hey
            @reptilians.band</a>!</br>
        So let's strap in and get ready to make some noise, cause the future is
        looking bright and we're excited to be a part of it!</p>
    <h2 class="title">Purpose of the documentation</h2>
    <p class="text">The purpose of this documentation is to give you, our
        community, a clear
        understanding of who we are, what we stand for, and what we're all
        about.
        We're not an average company, and we want to make sure you know that
        from
        the get-go.</br>
        </br>
        We believe in transparency and open communication, and this
        documentation is
        a reflection of that. We want you to know everything there is to know
        about
        us so that you can make an informed decision about whether or not you
        want
        to be a part of our community.</br>
        </br>
        This documentation is for anyone who wants to understand our company and
        its
        operations, for people who want to know about our products and services,
        for
        people who want to know about our vision, mission, goals, and values,
        for
        people who want to understand our token economy, our team, and our
        structure.</br>
        </br>
        We hope that this documentation will serve as a guide, not just for you,
        but
        for anyone interested in what we're doing and who wants to join us on
        this
        journey.</br>
        </br>
        <strong>*We tried very hard to keep this documentation short,
            understandable,
            and
            not look like a scammer. And it's very hard to write like that. So
            if you
            haven't read it, fuck off.</strong></p>
    <h2 class="title">Overview</h2>
    <p class="text">In short, we are IT-Company, b2c, focused on creating unique
        products with a focus on choice, where community members can have a
        direct influence on the development of our products through the use of
        Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). We are oriented to the whole world. And we
        are ready to change the world!</p>
    <details>
        <summary>More in-depth</summary>
        We're Reptilians that're out to shake things up and break free from the
        constraints of the status quo. We're focused on creating mobile games
        and mobile applications that are both fun and innovative, but we're not
        afraid to branch out and explore new opportunities - whether it's web
        services or other gaming platforms.</br>
    </br>
        And we're about flipping the script and creating a new model for how
        companies and communities can work together. Through our decentralized
        approach and our focus on community engagement, we hope to create a new
        model for how companies and communities can work together and show the
        world that decentralization is possible and that people can unite and
        manage their environment.
