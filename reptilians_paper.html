        documentation may change. We're in this together with our community, and
        we're looking forward to seeing how we can shape the future

        So let's strap in and get ready to make some noise, cause the future is

        from
        the get-go.</br>
        </br>
        We believe in transparency and open communication, and this

            and
            not look like a scammer. So

    <h2 class="title">Overview</h2>
    <p class="text">In short, we are IT-Company, b2c, focused on creating unique
        products with a focus on choice, where community members can have a
        direct influence on the development of our products through the use of
        Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). We are oriented to the whole world. And we
        are ready to change the world!</p>

        <summary>More in-depth</summary>
        <p class="text">
            We're Reptilians that're out to shake things up and
            break free from the
            constraints of the status quo. We're focused on creating mobile
            games
            and mobile applications that are both fun and innovative, but we're
            not
            afraid to branch out and explore new opportunities - whether it's
            web
            services or other gaming platforms.</br>
            </br>
            And we're about flipping the script and creating a new model for how
            companies and communities can work together. Through our
            decentralized
            approach and our focus on community engagement, we hope to create a
            new
            model for how companies and communities can work together and show
            the
            world that decentralization is possible and that people can unite
            and
            manage their environment.</p>

    <h2 class="title">Idea</h2>
    <p class="text">
        The idea behind Reptilians company is to disrupt the traditional way of
        user-company interaction and create a revolutionary decentralized
        approach where community members can have a direct influence on the
        development of our products through the use of Non-Fungible Tokens
        (NFTs).</br>
        </br>
        Reptilians are transparent as hell, with all data, backlogs, and
        roadmaps (and so on, and so on) made public while creating. We're not
        afraid to be open and honest with our community and we want them to be a
        part of the process every step of the way.</br>
        </br>
        <strong>Decentralization for us isn't the product, it is the
            tool</strong>. Our community
        members will have the power to vote on changes or offer their ideas for
        our products through our voting service. Our community is like a middle
        finger to centralized authority, giving the people control over the
        direction of the company.</br>
    </p>

    <details class="details">
        <summary>What do we believe?</summary>
        <p class="text">
            We believe in creating a comfortable and free community of
            like-minded people who share our values and are innovative and
            creative in our products. But most importantly, we're all about
            flipping the script and creating a new model for how companies and
            communities can work together. Through our approach and our focus on
            community engagement, we hope to create a new model for how
            companies and communities can interact and show the world that
            decentralization is possible and that people can unite and manage
            their environment.</br>
            </br>
            Reptilians is different from competitors because we're not just
            creating products and services, we're creating a new way for
            companies and communities to interact, we’re creating the community
            of Reptilians. All of these give our users a direct say in the
            development of our products and services. We believe that through
            our approach, we can create a new model for how companies and
            communities can work together.<strong> We're not content to just be
            another
            player in the industry, we want to be the ones leading the charge
            and paving the way for a new era of decentralized companies

    <h2 class="title">How it's gonna roll</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p class="text">Interaction based on NFTs is at the core of the Reptilians'
        mechanics. They are used as a way for community members to have a say in
        the development of the Reptilians' products and services. Community
        members can purchase or receive NFTs through marketing promotions or
        airdrops, and can also earn them by participating in certain activities.
        These NFTs serve as a passport for community members to influence all of
        the Reptilians' products (web-/mobile apps) and the very life of the
        company. Community members can vote on the Reptilians' plans and ideas,
        and propose their own ideas for voting by the community. The NFTs give
        community members a direct and tangible way to shape the direction of
        the Reptilians and its products.</p>
    <ol class="list">
        <li><p class="text">We mint NFTs</p></li>
        <li><p class="text">We give NFTs to the community</p></li>

            the vote supported by NFTs</p></li>

    <h3>How we mint NFTs</h3>

        <summary>More</summary>
        <ol class="list">
            <li><p class="text">We plan to mint NFT collections for each new
                product
                of the Reptilians to make it more diverse. Each NFT collection
                is
                unique and connected to the product it represents. It's like a
                little piece of the product's universe in your pocket.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text">All NFTs in these collections will be generated
                by
                our scripts and presets to have uniqueness and connection with
                our
                products.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text">The count of NFTs in each collection is
                different,
                it is based on our mood, the mood of the community, or the place
                of
                stars in the sky. But we are sure that there will not be more
                NFTs
                than 15k in the collection. </p></li>
            <li><p class="text">We won't use one blockchain and decided to use
                different blockchains for our collections to avoid the risks of
                web3. You know it is the wild west in web3 right now and
                sometimes
                blockchains are dying. </p></li>
            <li><p class="text">Also, we will mint rare collections in
                collaboration
                with our community through some activities, with digital and

    <h3>How does voting work</h3>
    <p class="text">In the beginning, we will use a simple chatbot or will make
        a process manually. But we have a plan to implement voting service on
        blockchain to automatize it and make a transparent. </br>
        </br>
        In general - it will be pretty simple, democratic, fair, and
        transparent. </p>
    <details class="details">
        <summary>Adios to traditional DAOs:</summary>
        <p class="text">We want to avoid classic DAO when the community can vote
            by the number of tokens because we haven't the goal to use tokens as
            a product, we want to make them as a tool. Because of it, we decide
            to make the voting process by the wallets that own NFT from the
            collection connected with the product.</br>
            </br>
            For example: If you have NFT from the GameName collection - you can
            vote for this game. If you have several NFTs for several collections
            - you can vote for products or services that are connected with
            these collections.
            And for those super special NFTs, like "Philosoraptors" on the
            Unique network
            and "Pixeraptors" on the Polygon, you'll have the ability to vote on
            all aspects of the Reptilians.</p>

        <li><p class="text">We're sharing it with the community.</p></li>
        <li><p class="text">Some of our NFT holders may have ideas for changes
            that they don't see on the list - no problem! They can add their own
            ideas to the list.</p></li>
        <li><p class="text">We'll give everyone some time to think about the
            changes before voting - after all, we're still working on some
            changes at this point.</p></li>
        <li><p class="text">The Reptilians will announce the start date of the

        <li><p class="text">On the voting start date, the first item on the list

        <li><p class="text">NFT holders will vote on specific options within the
            item. For example, it could be "Remove all ads from the game" with
            options "Yes" or "No". Or "Add a campaign mode to the game" with
            specific details for the options.</p></li>

    <h3>How do we protect ourselves from ourselves</h3>
    <p class="text">Yes, there is a lot of danger!
        We are trying to make a totally new approach to the world. But with that
        comes the risk of being attacked from all angles.</br>
        </br>
        Some examples of potential attacks include:</p>
    <ol class="list">
        <li><p class="text">Kind of attack of 51%, when somebody has the biggest
            part of the NFTs and could try to manipulate our voting system and
            disrupt our vision.</p></li>
        <li><p class="text">Maybe the community not being ready for the level of
            autonomy we're giving them and making poor decisions that could harm
            our company and ideas.</p></li>
        <li><p class="text">Social engineering tactics that attempt to
            manipulate individuals into harming the company and community.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p class="text">And let's be real, the list goes on and on.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p class="text">We're all about creating a self-governing anarchy-style
        community that will create something good and change the world in a good
        way, showing that people can make choices and build the world by
        themselves.</br>
        But, despite this, we need some rules which will bring freedom
        gradually. </br>
        </br>
        That's why we are creating several rules which will serve multiple
        purposes:</p>
    <ol class="list">
        <li><p class="text">Save and care for all of the community</p></li>
        <li><p class="text">Save and care for all of the employees of the

    </ol>
    <details class="details">
        <summary>Voting by wallets, not NFTs</summary>
        <p class="text">We're about keeping it fair and democratic, and that's
            why we're making sure that voting power is based on the wallet that
            owns the NFT, not the number of NFTs held. We need to avoid
            situations when somebody takes the biggest part of the NFTs and
            wants to make damage to a product or Reptilians. And also it makes
            voting not fair and not democratic - the voice of this guy will be
            stronger than the voice of somebody with 1 NFT. It isn't right. We
            want to make sure that everyone's voice is heard and that's why
            we're sticking to this approach.</br>
            </br>
            That's why we decide to make voting only by the wallet that owns
            NFT, doesn't matter how much - a million or one. </br>
            </br>
            Sure, there may be ways for bad actors to hack the system by using
            millions of wallets - but it will be a really difficult task for
            this bad guy. And looks like the "game won't be worth the candle"
            for him.</p>

        <summary>Veto of the founders</summary>
        <p class="text">We're all about community-driven decisions, but
            sometimes things can get some shit. We understand that sometimes the
            community may make decisions that could harm the Reptilians'
            potential. That's why, during the early stages of a product's life
            (about stages in the next block), the founders (4 indie developers
            who created the Reptilians) have the power to veto a decision made
            by the community. But don't worry, this veto power comes with
            responsibility. If the founders use it, they must provide a clear
            explanation for their decision. No shady business, just making sure
            we're not making any hasty decisions that could potentially harm the
            Reptilians or product. This way, the vetoed item goes back to the
            discussion table and the community (including the founders) can work
            together to find a solution.</br>
            </br>
            We want to keep it safe all aspects of the Reptilians, and we
            understand that there will be a possible situation when somebody
            pushed the community to close a potential idea before it brings
            results.</br>
            </br>
            But we remember our idea, mission, and goals. That's why we,
            founders, limit ourselves. These rules will be working only on the
            first stages of the product's life and after that, we will take away
            this right from ourselves. Because in the end, this is your company
            too.</p>
    </details>
    </br>
    <details class="details">
        <summary>Stages for the products of the Reptilians</summary>
        <p class="text">And here is the block about stages of the product's
            life. We're all about taking things step by step and that's why
            we've got stages for our products. We wanna make sure the community
            is ready to take on more responsibility as the product grows. We're
            starting off small and gradually giving more power to the community
            as we go. The influence of the community will be growth from the 1st
            stage and decision in the next features and changes, to the 4rt
            stage when the community can close the product and founders lose
            veto. Because the start of the product is the time when it can be
            buried really fast. </br>
            </br>
            <strong>Stage 1: NFT holders can vote on changes and propose new
                ideas for
                voting.</strong></br>
            <strong>Stage 2: NFT holders can do the same as stage 1, plus move
                the product to a "safe zone" (more on that in the next
                block).</strong></br>
            <strong>Stage 3: NFT holders can do the same as stage 2, plus close
                the product down if they want to.</strong></br>
            <strong>Stage 4: Founders can't use veto anymore.</strong></br>
            </br>
            We'll set a time frame for Stage 1 when we start working on a new
            product. It could be 6 months, 1 year, or more. We'll decide
            together with the community. As the product grows and develops,
            we'll move on to the next stages by voting.</p>

        <summary>Safe zone for the part of products</summary>
        <p class="text">We're all about creating a happy and safe work
            environment for our team and wanna create a kickass workplace for
            everyone in the Reptilians. So, we've got a "vice versa ban-hammer"
            in place, and it's used in a fair and just way.</br>
            </br>
            We've got a "Safe Zone" for three of our most important products.
            This zone is like a fortress that protects these products with all
            main streams of revenue from any unforeseen events and unexpected
            drama. It will make life safer for all teammates. </br>
            </br>
            But here's the catch, only three products can be in this zone at a
            time. So if the community wants to move a new product in, they have
            to decide which one to kick out. And remember, the founders can use
            their veto power if needed.</p>

        <summary>Locking NFTs and responsibility for decisions</summary>
        <p class="text">We believe in freedom, but we also believe in being
            responsible for our actions. So, if someone in our community makes a
            proposal or option inside the proposal that could harm our products
            or community, we want to make sure they share in that
            responsibility.</br>
            </br>
            To make sure this happens, any community member can flag the option
            inside the proposal as potentially harmful, with a reason why. Our
            team will then review these flags and if they're found to be true,
            the proposal or vote will be marked as harmful.</br>
            </br>
            Even if these harmful options win a vote, the NFT holders who voted
            for them won't be left off the hook. Their tokens, which were locked
            in smart contracts, will be sent to the company and distributed
            according to our tokenomics rules.</br>
            </br>
            It's all about taking responsibility for our actions and making sure
            we're moving forward as a community in a safe and responsible
            way.</p>

    <ol class="list">
        <li><p class="text">First and foremost, we plan to raise funds through
            the distribution of NFTs. This will give us a boost, allow us to

            let's not forget, NFTs are just a tool for us and will not be our
            main source of revenue.</p></li>
        <li><p class="text">Next up, we're working on implementing revenue
            streams for all our products that are comfortable for our users, and

            forward faster without compromising on user experience. And, of
            course, all these potential revenue streams will be agreed upon with
            our community.</p></li>
        <li><p class="text">Lastly, we're open to investments, but with a catch.
            Not many investors are willing to invest in a company as free as
            ours and we intend to keep it that way. So, we'll have some

        <summary>Structure</summary>
        <p class="text">We're all about working together, sharing
            responsibilities, and making
            sure all aspects of our product are covered.</p>
        <p class="text">But as we grow and bring on more teammates, we plan to
            structure
            ourselves in a more traditional way.</p>
        <ol class="list">
            <li><p class="text">We'll create product-specific teams that are
                responsible for all aspects of their product, like the Reptilian
                game team. They'll have a manager to handle communication with
                the community and oversee the product, and engineers to handle
                the technical side of things. Everyone has an equal say in these
                teams.</p></li>

            <li><p class="text">The company won't micromanage the teams, teams
                will have total freedom to do anything but each team will still
                have to follow the guidelines outlined in the Reptilians'
                paper.</p></li>

            <li><p class="text">We'll also have a Chief level position to
                coordinate all the teams and ensure the overall well-being of
                both the Reptilians community and the company.</p></li>
